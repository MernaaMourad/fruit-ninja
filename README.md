**Fruit Ninja**

**Description:**

It is a single player game in which the player slices fruits with a blade controlled by mouse swipes (finger swipes on touch screen). As the fruits are thrown
onto the screen, the player swipes the mouse across the screen to create a slicing motion, attempting to slice the fruits into two halves.


**Assumptions:**

*   **The game state is saved if the user pressed the save button, and is also automatically saved after the user beats the highest score so that everytime an
    object is sliced the game state is saved.**

*   **If the user loses after reaching the highest score then the current score is reset to 0 and the game objects are reset keeping the highest score, so that
    the user can’t save before losing and load the game from the state at which he saved while the highest score has already been updated with a higher one 
    than in the pre-mentioned state.**


**Labor Division**

*  	We used “TeamViewer” application that allows sharing the screen to be able to work together at the same time.

*  	Sometimes one of us make some modifications to the code and inform the others so that we are updated with all the modifications and each one of the team 
    members has a complete set of zipped files showing the progress of our project, making our program more efficient.
